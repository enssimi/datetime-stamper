    <h1>Date/Time Stamper</h1>
    <p>
      This is a simple Python program that adds a date/time stamp to a photo. It uses the Piexif library to read the EXIF metadata from the photo and PIL library to add the date/time stamp. The program is designed to be run from the command line or using a graphical user interface built with tkinter.
